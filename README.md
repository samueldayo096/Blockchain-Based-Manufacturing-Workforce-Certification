# Blockchain-Based Manufacturing Workforce Certification

This repository implements a decentralized solution for managing and verifying manufacturing workforce certifications, qualifications, and authorizations. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system creates immutable, transparent records of worker credentials and ensures only properly qualified personnel perform specific manufacturing tasks.

## Core Components

### Employee Verification Contract
- Secure digital identity system for manufacturing personnel
- Cryptographic verification of worker credentials
- Employment history and authorization records
- Multi-factor authentication for secure facility access
- Privacy-preserving identity management

### Skill Certification Contract
- Immutable record of training completions and qualifications
- Integration with certification authorities and training providers
- Skill expiration and renewal management
- Proficiency level tracking and verification
- Credential portability across manufacturing facilities

### Station Assignment Contract
- Authorization management for specific manufacturing positions
- Real-time validation of worker qualification for assigned tasks
- Shift planning with credential verification
- Temporary authorization provisions with audit trails
- Equipment-specific certification requirements

### Compliance Tracking Contract
- Regulatory requirement monitoring and enforcement
- Automated alerts for certification gaps or expirations
- Audit-ready reports of workforce compliance status
- Verification of proper certifications for completed work
- Historical records for regulatory inspections

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Safety**: Ensures only qualified personnel operate equipment
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Simplified auditing and documentation
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined credential verification process
- **Reduced Liability**: Verifiable records of proper workforce qualification
- **Workforce Development**: Clear visibility into skill gaps and training needs

## Implementation Guide

The system uses distributed ledger technology to create tamper-proof records of workforce certifications while providing appropriate privacy controls. Implementation instructions for integration with HR systems, training platforms, and shop floor access controls are included in the documentation.

## Getting Started

Setup instructions and API documentation can be found in the implementation guide. The system is designed to integrate with existing manufacturing execution systems (MES) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms.
